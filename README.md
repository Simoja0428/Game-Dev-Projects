# Game-Dev-Projects
The following repository contains the games I have developed up to this point. All games were created using Unity and scripted using C#. Although there is a varying complexity in each of the games, each game gave me the oppurtunity to learn new skills in both Unity and C# programming.

## The Guiding Light
*The Guiding Light* is a text adventure game that is meant as a first project for someone using Unity or C#. Although short, the game gives the user a variety of options to choose their path. The game makes use of several fundamental concepts in game development, including but not limited to: states, user input through keys, and changing states/text information using C# scripting.

## Number Hacker
*Number Hacker* is less of a game and more of an interactive UI. In this interactive UI, the user thinks of a number, the computer will then attempt to randomly guess this number. As the user you will then click the corresponding 'Higher' 'Lower' or 'Success' button based on the computer's guess. This project makes use of several more new fundamental concepts in game development, including but not limited to: updating variables through C# scripts, user input through the mouse, and writing functions in C# scripts.

## Royal Block Breaker
*Royal Block Break* is the first game to introduce the idea of levels. The player uses their mouse to control a little pad at the bottom of the screen; moving the pad back and forth the player needs to bounce the ball until it breaks all the blocks on the screen to beat the level and move on. Royal Block Breaker makes use of tons of important concepts in game developement, including but not limited to: creating/editing assests, making use of rigid bodies and collision detectors to effectively create a gravity system, and creating/editing new scenes to introduce the concept on levels.
