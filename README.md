# Game-Dev-Introductory-Projects
The following repository contains the first three games I completed in game development. All games past this point were unfournately too large to upload but are available upon request with their descriptions down below. All games were created using Unity and scripted using C#. Although there is a varying complexity in each of the games, each game gave me the oppurtunity to learn new skills in both Unity and C# programming.

## The Guiding Light
*The Guiding Light* is a text adventure game that is meant as a first project for someone using Unity or C#. Although short, the game gives the user a variety of options to choose their path. The game makes use of several fundamental concepts in game development, including but not limited to: states, user input through keys, and changing states/text information using C# scripting.

## Number Hacker
*Number Hacker* is less of a game and more of an interactive UI. In this interactive UI, the user thinks of a number, the computer will then attempt to randomly guess this number. As the user you will then click the corresponding 'Higher' 'Lower' or 'Success' button based on the computer's guess. This project makes use of several more new fundamental concepts in game development, including but not limited to: updating variables through C# scripts, user input through the mouse, and writing functions in C# scripts.

## Royal Block Breaker
*Royal Block Break* is the first game to introduce the idea of levels. The player uses their mouse to control a little pad at the bottom of the screen; moving the pad back and forth the player needs to bounce the ball until it breaks all the blocks on the screen to beat the level and move on. Royal Block Breaker makes use of tons of important concepts in game developement, including but not limited to: creating/editing assests, making use of rigid bodies and collision detectors to effectively create a gravity system, and adding in sound/visual effects to an event in the game.

## Abstract Survival (Available Upon Request)
*Abstract Survival* is meant to be a top down shooter game. In the game, the user controls a pirate ship floating through space. Using the arrow keys and space bar, the player must avoid/destroy oncoming enemy ships through out numerous levels before finally making it to a boss ship. This game makes usage of a bunch of new features in game development: most notably the usage of a particle system for background effects, background level music, and automated enemies that were controlled by scripts. 

## Past Life (Available Upon Request)
*Past Life* is meant to be a parody of Plants vs. Zombies. In this game, containing three levels, instrucions to play, loading screens, and settings to control the music of the game, the player is tasked witth fending off an onslaught of different enemies. Each level is on a timer. Enemies will spawn in a pattern out of the particle system before walking towards the player. The player is able to purchase different defenders to put down on the grid map in order to run out the timer and win. 

## Disco Tetris (Available Upon Request)
*Disco Tetris* is a personal project that I completed in just under 48 hours. The game is a modern day reimplementation of Tetris. Using the 'WASD' and 'R' keys the player controls a series of randomly generated blocks. The goal is to complete as many lines as the player possibly can before the pieces can no longer spawn. Each piece after spawning automatically drops down the grid; it is important to note this is done by transforming the objects through a 2D Array to get that ticking motion in the original Tetris, not using traditional Unity physics. In addition, the game contains music, load screens, multiple line at a time completion support, and instructions/setttings pages.
