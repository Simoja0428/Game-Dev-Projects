# Game-Dev-Projects
The following repository contains the games I have developed up to this point. All games were created using Unity and scripted using C#. Although there is a varying complexity in each of the games, each game gave me the oppurtunity to learn new skills in both Unity and C# programming.

## The Guiding Light
*The Guiding Light* is a text adventure game that is meant as a first project for someone using Unity or C#. Although short, the game gives the user a variety of options to choose their path. The game makes use of several fundamental concepts in game development, including but not limited to: states, user input through keys, and changing states/text information using C# scripting.
